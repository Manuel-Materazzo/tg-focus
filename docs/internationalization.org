* Message Format

All messages collected by tg-focus will reassemble, in such form:

#+begin_src raw
[ <FWDED_HDR_CHAT> ] AAAAAA
[ <FWDED_HDR_SENDER> ] BBBBBB
[ <FWDED_HDR_MSG> ] CCCCCC
[ <FWDED_HDR_DATE> ] DDDDDD
[ <FWDED_HDR_ID> ] EEEEEE
#+end_src

The placeholders =<...>= will all be replaced by specific text
depending on the language used by tg-focus(the language used by
tg-focus can be confirmed by command =tgf-conf version=).

Placeholders are:

| Placeholder      | Meaning                             |
|------------------+-------------------------------------|
| FWDED_HDR_CHAT   | The header name for "Chat" field    |
| FWDED_HDR_Sender | The header name for "Sender" field  |
| FWDED_HDR_MSG    | The header name for "Content" field |
| FWDED_HDR_DATE   | The header name for "Date" field    |
| FWDED_HDR_ID     | The header name for "ID" field      |

The placeholder-text mapping is listed in =dev/i18n.csv=.

For example, for language "English (United States)", the corresponding
language code is "en_US", which has corresponding row in
=dev/i18n.csv=:

| TGF_LANG | FWDED_HDR_CHAT | FWDED_HDR_SENDER | FWDED_HDR_MSG | FWDED_HDR_DATE | FWDED_HDR_ID | - |
|----------+----------------+------------------+---------------+----------------+--------------+---|
| en_US    | CHAT           | SENDER           | CONTENT       | DATE           | ID           | - |

This will reassemble a new message as the following:

#+begin_src raw
[ CHAT ] AAAAAA
[ SENDER ] BBBBBB
[ CONTENT ] CCCCCC
[ DATE ] DDDDDD
[ ID ] EEEEEE
#+end_src

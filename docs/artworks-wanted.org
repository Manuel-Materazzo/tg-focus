* Artwork Collection

Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m looking to add some beautiful artworks to enhance the projectâ€™s
visual appeal. However, Iâ€™m not a painter or artist myself, so Iâ€™m
reaching out to you guys for help.

** What I Need 

/Icon/Logo/: Iâ€™m specifically looking for an icon or logo that
represents the essence of tg-focus. It should be memorable, simple, 
and reflect the main goal of the project: **focus**. 

/Configuration Demonstrations/: Apart from the icon, Iâ€™d like series of
screenshots that capture the steps for configuring tg-focus to get it
worked, just like the ones already emebbed in README's "A Simple Demo"
section, which are demonstrations in English. I need more languages,
but there should be no more than 15 pics for each language.

** How You Can Contribute

*** Create Art

If youâ€™re an artist, designer, or just someone with a
flair for creativity, I invite you to contribute your artwork! Whether
itâ€™s a hand-drawn sketch, a digital masterpiece, or anything in
between, your work will be appreciated. 

*** Submit Your Art

To contribute, simply create an issue in this
repository and upload your artwork files. Feel free to provide a brief

Rewards: As a token of appreciation, Iâ€™m open to offering

# Artwork Collection

Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹ tg-focus's appearance now needs to be more
distinguishable. So I am looking for some beautiful artworks to
enhance the projectâ€™s appearance.


<a id="orgd3d6aa6"></a>

## What I Need

*Icon/Logo*: Iâ€™m **specifically** looking for an icon or logo that
represents the essence of tg-focus. And it will be used as default
avatar for *TG-FOCUS* group. It should be memorable, simple, and
reflect the main goal of the project: **focus**.

*Configuration Demonstrations*: Apart from the icon, Iâ€™d like series of
screenshots that capture the steps of process configuring tg-focus to
get it worked, just like the ones already emebbed in README's "A Simple Demo"
section, which are demonstrations in English. I need more languages,
but there should be no more than 15 pics for each language.

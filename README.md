# TG-Focus

tg-focus is a comprehensive **text** message forwarder for Telegram. It can
filter raw text messages, media captions or even emoji messages.
By customizing *Focus Filters*, tg-focus can forward any specific
message from any specific chat, to one dedicated chat, so that users
have fully control on the messages they'd see.

Telegram is famous for its openness. While users are free to make a
speech in any public chat, they should be equally free to choose what
they'd see. Telegram's official client apps have excellent support
for the former feature, tg-focus and other couterparts are trying to
fill the blank in the latter one. 

Notable features:

-   **Reliable & Consistent**: Built on top of official
    C++ library([TDLib](https://core.telegram.org/tdlib/)). All
    communications towards Telegram servers are completely handled by
    TDLib.

-   **Easy to use**: Users can customize *Focus Filters* any
    time they like. The filter accepts both simple text and regular 
    expressions. The configuration file is in human-readable
    [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) format.

-   **Ready to deploy**: Releases are made in three forms: source,
    binary and OCI image. Users can run it directly on a laptop,
    or use [docker](https://www.docker.com)/[podman](https://podman.io/) to
    deploy it on their servers, without interfering with each other.

# How To Use

Before anything make sure you have:

1. A Telegram phone-loginable account
2. A telegram API ID and corresponding API HASH, they can be obtained 
   at https://my.telegram.org. 

Suppose you're:


## Using OCI Image

Assume you have docker/podman installed on your system already:

1. Pull the image and run:

```sh
docker pull xxx
docker run -d xxx
```

2. Login your telegram account first, here it needs API ID, API HASH,
and your phone number:

```sh
docker exec -it <container-name> tf-conf auth
```

3. If logined successfullly, a new chat named `TG-FOCUS` will be
   created, the subsequent messages will be filtered and forwarded to
   this chat.

4. Change the *Focus Filter*s any time you like, to make adjustment on
   the messages you would like to see on that chat.

```sh
docker exec -it <container-name> tf-conf filters
```

5. Done



## Using Prebuilt Binaries

1. Download the binaries.

2. Login your Telegram account first, it needs API ID, API HASH, and your
phone number, the first two can be obtained in https://my.telegram.org:

```sh
/path/to/tf-conf auth
```

3. Launch tg-focus daemon:

```sh
/path/to/tf-focusd
```

4. If logined successfullly, a new chat named `TG-FOCUS` will be
   created, the subsequent messages will be filtered and forwarded to
   this chat.

5. Change the *Focus Filter*s any time you like, to make adjustment on
   the messages you would like to see on that chat.

```sh
/path/to/tf-conf filters
```

6. Done



# Filtering Rules

A *Focus Filter* is a filter used by tg-focus to match against the
message's text content(raw text, emoji, or media caption). There can
be many filters, when a message comes, they are tried one by one, if
there is any filter than can *match* the message, it will be
forwarded.

Currently *Focus Filter* can *match*:

1. Chat title
2. Text keywords
3. Message senders

can *reject*:

1. Text keywords
2. Message senders

A message is forwarded if and only if:

- the message is matched by a *Focus Filter*, **and**
- the message is not rejected by that *Focus Filter*.

(Hence, the first 1/2/3 can be regarded as **whitelist** filters, the
second 1/2 can be regarded as **blacklist** filters)


## Filter Examples

Say we want to forward all messages in a chat named
"üëçAnAwesomeChatüëç": 

works, the chat title is fully matched: 

```toml
[[focus-filter]]
title = "üëçAnAwesomeChatüëç"
```

works, the chat title is partly matched:

```toml
[[focus-filter]]
title = "AnAwesomeChat"
```

works, the chat title is partly matched: 

```toml
[[focus-filter]]
title = "Awesome"
```

works, the chat title is partly matched:

```toml
[[focus-filter]]
title = "üëç"
```

works, the regular expression matches the chat title:

```toml
[[focus-filter]]
title = ".*Awesome.*"
```

Say we want to forward the messages that contain "football", but not
"basketball", from a chat named "Sports User Group". We can write our filters as

```toml
[[focus-filter]]
title = "Sports User Group"
keywords = ["football", "soccer"]
no-keywords = ["basketball"]
```

Say we want the messages containing "football", or any other
messages except the ones containing "basketball", and the ones sent by
the user whose full name is "Basketball Lover", or the ones sent by the
user whose user ID is "alice_love_basketball", from a chat named
"SportsUserGroup". We can write the filter as:

```toml
# 1st
[[focus-filter]]
title = "Sports User Group"
keywords = ["football", "soccer"]

# 2nd
[[focus-filter]]
title = "Sports User Group"
no-keywords = ["basketball"]
no-senders = ["Basketball Love", "@alice_love_basketball"]
```

So these message will be forwarded:

- `Alice: I love football!` (matching the 1st)
- `Bob: I play soccer.` (matching the 1st)
- `Alice: I am good at swimming.` (matching the 2nd)
- `Bob: Sometime I also play badminton.` (matching the 2nd)
- `Alice: I play football and basketball.` (matching the 1st, skip the 2nd)

these will NOT be forwarded:

- `Alice: I play badminton and basketball.` (matching the 2nd's
  "no-keywords" means a *reject*)
- `Basketball Lover: Hellop everyone!` (a *reject* by the 2nd)
- `Alice @alice_love_basketball: Hi, I am Alice, I love sports.`
  (a *reject* by the 2nd)



# Q&A

## Can I trust tg-focus?

tg-focus inherits the openness from TDLib, its source, and its
dependencies' source are fully open. Additionally all its binaries and
OCI images will **not** be built by any individual, but by 
Github-hosted containers. Users are free to verify if binaries'
checksums or docker images metainfo are identical to the original
build artifacts on [Github Action
page](https://github.com/micl2e2/tg-focus/actions). 

Telegram bot is helpful for some specific tasks, but not sufficient
to be a **comprehensive** message forwarder. Therefore, during
authorization process, tg-focus needs to login in user's account,
which in turn needs user's phone number and login code,
just as any functional Telegram client would require. It only save
API ID and API HASH on user's local machine because these two are
required each time when TDLib initializes. But under **no**
circumstances would tg-focus save user's phone number. 

If users are still worrying about tg-focus, consider that tg-focus is
a GPL-licensed free software. And as mentioned above, every single
line of source code is open, and every single person is free to check
the code, and of course, to contribute.
